UVa
===

A repository of my personal solutions to [UVa](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8) problems, in the (rough) order of incrementing difficulty as suggested by [uhunt](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/)

## C++

- **Testing**: `sandbox/cpp-test.sh` for Linux/MacOS; `sandbox/cpp-test-windows.ps1` for Windows
- **Publish**: `sandbox/cpp-publish.sh`

## Java

- **Testing**: `sandbox/test-java.sh` 
- **Publish**: sandbox/java-publish.sh/cpp-publish.sh`
- Ensure class is named  `Main` before submitting to UVa to avoid runtime error.
